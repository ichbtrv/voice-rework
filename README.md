## General UX Overview 

Any old notes are read from local storage. 
The dashboard first prompts you to record a message by clicking the microphone. 
The audio is recorded and transcribed into a note.
You can either save or edit the note. 
When you save the note a modal pops up and asks you to add a title to the note (and allows you to edit further)
The note is then saved to localStorage
You can view all of your notes in the note view by clicking the folder
